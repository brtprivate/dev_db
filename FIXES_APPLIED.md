# MongoDB GUI - Document Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JSON Documents Not Visible
**Problem**: Documents were loading from the database but not displaying properly in the UI due to missing functions and styling issues.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added missing `highlightJson()` function for proper JSON syntax highlighting
- Added missing `formatBytes()` helper function for file size display
- Added missing `viewDocumentModal()`, `copyDocumentJson()`, and related functions
- Fixed event handling by replacing problematic inline onclick handlers with proper event listeners
- Added proper CSS styling for document containers and JSON display

### 2. Improved JSON Display
**Enhancements**:
- JSON is now properly formatted with syntax highlighting (colors for keys, values, numbers, booleans, null)
- Documents are displayed in expandable containers with size information
- Added "View Full" and "Copy JSON" buttons for each document
- Improved responsive design and readability

### 3. Better User Experience
**Features Added**:
- Document modal viewer for full JSON inspection
- Copy to clipboard functionality with fallback for older browsers
- Download JSON functionality
- Proper loading states and error handling
